"""
Functions for processing and comparing the two sources of solar radiance data
"""

"""
Runs a basic algorithm to detect anomalies between two signals

Inputs:
 - time: A `numpy.ndarray` of unix times
 - signal1: A `numpy.ndarray` of the first signal
 - signal2: A `numpy.ndarray` of the second signal

Outputs:
 - A dictionary with the following keys:
    `feature`: A `numpy.ndarray` of the error between the signals
    `mean_shift`: A `numpy.ndarray` reflecting a rolling statistic of the feature
    `anomalies`: A `list` of times when there is an anomoly detected

Assumptions:
 - all arrays have the same length
 - elements of both signal arrays align with the time array
 - nan's are skipped
 - missing data isn't handled specially
